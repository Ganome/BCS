Phase 1:

#BEGIN----CODE

#This scripts requires a 3rd party tool for converting spreadsheets to plaintext!
sudo apt install gnumeric #this comes installed on many debian distributions!
#Command to convert spreadsheed into human readable and parsable in shell environment
ssconvert Rockstarserverlist.xlsx rockstarserverlist.csv
#command to ping all Hollywood servers in the new .csv list and output all data into server_results.txt
grep -i holly rockstarserverlist.csv  | sed 's/\// /g' |awk {'print $1'} | fping | tee server_results.txt #Using tee here instead of a ">" so we can read stdout and log at same time.
grep alive server_results.txt | awk '{print $1}' > alive_servers.txt
#The last grep command finds any servers that respond to fping as "alive" and puts them in a seperate file called "alive_servers.txt"

#END-----CODE

#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#RECCOMENDATIONS=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#
All the results are saved into a file called server_results.txt, the servers that responded are saved in a file called "alive_servers.txt"  
From my tests, i have concluded that One server is reachable with a ping request and that server has the IP : 167.172.144.11.
It is recommended to stop accepting or forwarding ICMP traffic with this server (167.172.144.11).
These results are founds in the Network or Layer 3 of the OSI model.

Phase 2:

#There is only one command in this step.  Im using the generated file from the step above to only scan the hosts that are "alive"
sudo nmap -sS -iL alive_servers.txt -oN scan_server.txt #this command scans the host and saves ouotput to "scan_server.txt"

#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#RECCOMENDATIONS=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#
After performing a SYN scan on machine 167.172.144.11; I have found One open port.  This is an SSH port located at TCP port number 22.
After reviewing "scan_server.txt"; we can see that this particular server has port 22 open to the public.  This is a big NO NO!
***WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND "systemctl disable sshd" or at MINIMUM, REQUIRE A Pre-Shared Key pair (PSK)**
The results from this scan can be seen in the file "scan_server.txt".  The SYN scan runs on level 7 of the OSI model.  This is because layer-7 is the "Presentation" layer, 
or the layer the user interacts with.  Since SSH is a program that we directly interact with, it falls into layer 7.

Phase 3:

we connect to the ssh server with the command: ssh jimi@167.172.144.11 #no -p is needed beause its on the default port 22. When prompted for a password enter "hendrix"

found tampering in the "/etc/hosts" file using command "cat /etc/hosts"
#Reason for redirected rollingstones.com
98.137.246.8 rollingstone.com #located inside /etc/hosts

98.137.246.8 resolves to: media-router-fp72.prod.media.vip.gq1.yahoo.com

#ran "ls -alh" in /etc to look for traces of hacker (hint from homework on location)
Found file /etc/packetcaptureinfo.txt - which contained a link to Google Drive. Which in turn gave me the secretlogs.pcapng

All this information also used OSI layer-7, because I was actively using an SSH connection.

#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#
Phase 4:

#Off-Topic Personal note, all the connections in the "secretlogs.pcapng" are supposed to be from the Hollywood office of Rockstar.
#The IP of the rockstar office in question (Hollywood) is 167.172.144.11; yet this IP does not appear once in the logs!

wireshark -f secretlogs.pcapng #run this command in the same folder as the packet capture

Line 5 of the packet capture shows possible ARP spoofing.

Line 16 of the packet capture log, MrHacker "Hacker@rockstarcorp.com posted in the "www.gottheblues.com" message board, offering login details to the
rockstar network in exchange for $1 Million dollars.

In this phase, the ARP protocol used OSI layers-2&3.  Mapping MAC addresses(2) to IP numbers(3).
The HTTP POST/GET used Layer-7 of the OSI model.

In summary, I would recommend a better pre-employment screening.  This could potentially catch possible future employees of ulterior motives.  Also, if the employee
has access to important information, a credit check might also be a good idea.
Close all ports that are not explicitly needed on public facing servers. Ie. SSH
Create a DMZ for your webserver, and keep everything else private.
FIRE Mr. Hacker, and change login credentials for jimi:hendrix (hopefully implement PSK for SSH)
