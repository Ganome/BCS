Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on /etc/shadow should allow only root read and write access.
Command to inspect permissions: 
ls -alh /etc/shadow

Command to set permissions (if needed): 
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow && sudo chown root:root /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on /etc/gshadow should allow only root read and write access.
Command to inspect permissions: 
ls -alh /etc/gshadow

Command to set permissions (if needed): 
sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow && sudo chown root:root /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on /etc/group should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
Command to inspect permissions: 
ls -alh /etc/group

Command to set permissions (if needed): 
sudo chmod 604 /etc/group && sudo chown root:root /etc/group

4. Permissions on /etc/passwd should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
Command to inspect permissions:
ls -alh /etc/passwd 

Command to set permissions (if needed):
sudo chmod 604 /etc/passwd && sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd

Step 2: Create User Accounts


1. Add user accounts for sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin.
Command to add each user account (include all five users):
useradd -m sam
adduser joe #this method is not as easy or as clean as above - as this is the Debian adduser script, and asks for a bunch on useless info like Full Name, Room #, Other
useradd -m amy #the "-m" tells it to create a home, and does not set a password for the user.
adduser sara
adduser admin

4. Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.
Command to add admin to the sudo group: 
usermod -aG sudo admin

-------------==============------------------

Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an engineers group to the system.
Command to add group: 
groupadd engineers

2. Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.
Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users):
usermod -aG engineers sam
usermod -aG engineers joe
usermod -aG engineers amy
usermod -aG engineers sara

3. Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.
Command to create the shared folder:
sudo mkdir /home/engineers && sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers && sudo chmod 770 /home/engineers #I am aware that i left the folder owned by USER:root, but the group has read/write and the dir is owned by the group engineers, so no issues.  I also left root permissions to read/wrire/execute, which is basically redundant.


4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.
Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
sudo chown:engineers /home/engineers #this should have been done when first creating the "shared" directory!!  *PFFT*

-------------==============------------------

Step 4: Lynis Auditing


1. Command to install Lynis:
sudo apt install lynis -y # the "-y" skips the confirmation (Y/n)

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
sudo lynis --help OR man lynis

3. Command to run an audit:
sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
Screenshot of report output:

-------------==============------------------

Bonus

1. Command to install chkrootkit:
sudo apt install chkrootkit -y # the "-y" skips the confirmation (Y/n)

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man chkrootkit

3. Command to run expert mode:
sudo chkrootkit -x

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
Screenshot of end of sample output:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14RkY-2cv7INTdfz4m1CW0RXHb4Y8G-Vr?usp=sharing #I also output the entire log to chkrootkit.output - plain text file
