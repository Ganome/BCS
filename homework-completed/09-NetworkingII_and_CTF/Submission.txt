			MISSION 1:

Server:  beefypi
Address:  192.168.100.100

starwars.com	MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt1.aspx.l.google.com
starwars.com	MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx3.googlemail.com
starwars.com	MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx2.googlemail.com
starwars.com	MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = aspmx.l.google.com
starwars.com	MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt2.aspmx.l.google.com

They are not receiving email because their mail servers "asltx.l.google.com" & "asltx.2.google.com" are not listed.
In order to receive email, they need to replace tghe old servers in the list with the new mail servers.
Ie. starwars.com	"MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = asltx.l.google.com"
			"MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = asltx.2.google.com"
This leaves the primary server with a wieght of "One", so it gets priority.  The weight oof 5 is a fallback.  If their weights were the same, they would share the load and alternate.


			MISSION 2:
Address: 192.168.100.100#53
Non-authoritative answer:
theforce.nettext = "v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215"

The SPF Record, which is actually stored in the TXT record here; because this
server is non-compliant with RFC7208 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208 -
Does not list the new mail server "45.23.176.21" as an authorized mail authority

In order to fix this, they would need to edit the DNS TXT record's third line,
which contains the SPF; or ideally add the SPF record seperately in accordance
with RFC 7208, they are 6 years past the recommended change over.'

On a sidenote, an SPF record shows what servers are allowed to "sign" or "send"
mail on behalf of a certain domain or network.  The actual mail servers (MX) are
usually seperate machines/hosts.

The MX host forwards mail the the SPF who then sends it to the outside world, or
recipient.


Mission 3:
Non-authoritative answer:
www.theforce.net	  canonical name = theforce.net.

when running an nslookup on resistance.theforce.net - the site does not even
exist.  But if it did, the CNAME should look something like:
"resistance.theforce.net    cannonical name = theforce.net"
Once again they would need to edit their DNS records and actually put a server
online.  They are definitely getting ahead of themselves.  The sub-page of
resistance.theforce.net does not even exist!  But if it did, they would need to
add the CNAME record above ^.


      Mission 4:

nslookup -type=any princessleia.site
Server:		192.168.100.100
Address:	192.168.100.100#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	princessleia.site
Address: 34.102.136.180
princessleia.site	nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com.
princessleia.site	nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com.
princessleia.site
	origin = ns25.domaincontrol.com

The above shows that the backup DNS server "ns2.galaxybackup.com" is not listed,
In order to help the connection loss in the future, add the
"ns2.galaxybackup.com" as a backup nameserver for princessleia.site.  The
Resistance should also list princessleia.site 's nameservers, this way
princessleia is upstream from theforce.net and will be one of the initial search
paths for DNS records.
