## Activity File: Lists and Loops

In the previous activity we added variables to our script.  We also added conditional flow control using `if` statements.

Next, you will use loops to automate repetitive tasks in your script.

Loops facilitate code reuse, by allowing commands to be run many times without actually typing them repeatedly.

This adds another layer of sophistication and efficiency to your script.

To complete this activity, you will create several `for` loops that satisfy given requirements. If you get to the bonus, you can incorporate a `for` loop into your script.

### Create your script file.

1. Create a new file named `for_loops.sh` and open it in your text editor.

2. Add the required `hashbang` line at the top so your computer knows it's a bash script.

### Create your variables

Create a variable that holds a list of 5 of your favorite U.S. states (e.g. Nebraska, Hawaii, California, etc.)

### Create a `for` loop

Create a `for` loop that prints out each state one by one. If it finds "Hawaii" print out a special note for Hawaii only

### Bonuses
1. Create another variable that holds the output of the command `ls`. Then, create a `for` loop that prints out each item of this variable.

2. Use a for loop to print out the location of each file anywhere in `/home` that has `600` permissions
 
3. Create a variable that holds a list of numbers from `0-10`. Then, create a `for` loop that prints out only the even ones from your list of numbers.
